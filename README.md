# Workout-Tracker
Since I have started pushing my code to github I have realized that it has lead to an increased consistency in terms of working every single day on my projects. 
I figured a mechanism like this should be developed for other activities as well where you want to be consistent. 
This project  makes use of the Pixela API to track my workouts. I was confused what to put as a unit so for now I have gone with the pump I get. Let me know if you 
have any better suggestions. At the time when I am writing this, the project does not have a mechanism to record activities every single day. 
The only way to update the activity is by manually running the code which is a little tedious. I hope to automate this process soon!
